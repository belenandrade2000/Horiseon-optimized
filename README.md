# Horiseon Optimized

## Description

This website was created as a way to teach individuals about the tools available to them in order for their website to reach more users. I built this project because it provides a clear, navigational way to learn about seach engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. This are all toolscompanies with websites need to be aware of in order to increase their website traffic and positive feedback output. Through this challenge, I learned the importance of easy website nagivation for the user, clean aesthetics, and accesibility standards.
